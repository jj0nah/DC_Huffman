Dinner' would be the top node and its values (chicken, beef, etc.) are below it. Referring to the link, the graph function takes two parametersa source and a node.It would look something like thisxcept 'king' would be 'dinner' and 'lord' would be 'chicken', 'beef', etc.My question is How do I access a key in a value? To create a tree from this data I feel like I need to create a loop which checks if there is a value for a specific key and plots it. I'm not sure how to call values for any dictionary object (if it's not necessarily called 'dinner' or have as many elements.).
